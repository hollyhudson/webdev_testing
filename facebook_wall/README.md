##Scope

This project involves creating a simple Facebook-like wall. The objective of this project is for students to practice their jQuery skills. Unlike previous projects, students are presented with minimal scaffolding.
 
##Before Class

### Prerequisites
Students should only start this project after they have completed the other lessons and projectsin the unit.

### Starter code

See [here](starter_code/) for code and [here](https://rawgit.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/curriculum/master/units/10-jquery/lessons/2-project/starter_code/index.html) to view.

### Solution code

See [here](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/solutions/tree/master/units/10-jquery/lessons/2-project/solution_code) for code (private).

### Assessment

1. Students will be assessed based on their performance in the project.

##During Class

###Do Now

1. Attendance
2. Return graded do-now and exit ticket from previous class
3. [Do-now](doNow.md) activity

###Opening

What is the Facebook wall? How does it work? 

Let's see a live demonstration by showing off the solution code preview.

###Lecture

You are going to build a simple Facebook Wall. Your instructions:


#### 1. Fork this Repo
Do this by clicking the Fork button on the top right of this page.

#### 2. Clone your repo into your own Cloud9 account workspace
1. Copy the "clone URL" from this repo
2. In your Cloud9 dashboard click on the green "Create New Workspace" button and select "Clone from URL"


#### 3. Fill out `wall.js`

You must fill out `js/wall.js`. Unlike previous projects, there is very little starter code given. This is on purpose.

#### 4. Test

To test if your Wall works as expected, post the following messages in order: "First message", "Second message", "Third message". Afterwards, your Wall should look like:

###Brainstorming
Before you start coding, identify the list of steps you need to do to finish this project. Here's a start:

1. Read `index.html`. Pay attention to the IDs of the text box, button, and `div` at the bottom.
2. How will you detect the click on the "Post" button?
3. What should happen once the "Post" button is clicked? Will you need to generate HTML? 

###Build Time
Students will work alone on this project. The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any questions they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference.

##Closing
Select students to present their work to the class.

###Check for Understanding
Teachers should keep track of student success while they are presenting to the class.

###How to Submit
This project must be pushed back up to your repo on GitHub. Then you will share your link with the instructor

To push to GitHub run the following commands in your terminal: 
`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`
